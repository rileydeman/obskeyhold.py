## üß© Overview

`obskeyhold.py` is a **Windows-only helper tool** designed for streamers who use **OBS Studio** while playing games such as *Rust*, *DayZ*, or other open-world titles where showing the in-game map could reveal their position to viewers.

When you hold down certain keys in-game, OBS can automatically toggle overlays or sources (like hiding a map capture).  
This script automates that key press/release behavior, using Python to send **virtual key events (F13‚ÄìF24)** ‚Äî keys that OBS can detect as hotkeys without interfering with your normal gameplay.

**Core Features**
- üéÆ Hold-to-toggle behavior for hiding in-game maps.
- üß† Lightweight and simple to run ‚Äî no setup tools or extra dependencies required.
- ü™ü Designed specifically for **Windows 10/11 (x64)**.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Easy customization through the `config/variables.py` file.

**Use case example**
> You hold `G` to open your in-game map ‚Äî OBS automatically hides your map overlay so viewers can‚Äôt see your location. When you release `G`, the map reappears in your stream.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

Follow these steps to install and run **obskeyhold.py**:

1. **Download the latest release**
   - Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/rileydeman/obskeyhold.py/releases) page.
   - Under **Assets**, download the file named **Source code (zip)**.
   - This will download a file such as `obskeyhold.py-1.0.0.zip`.

2. **Extract the files**
   - Right-click the ZIP file ‚Üí **Extract All...**
   - Choose a simple folder path, for example:  
     `C:\obskeyhold`

3. **Open Command Prompt in that folder**
   - Open the folder where you extracted the project.  
   - Click on the **address bar** in File Explorer (the path at the top).  
   - Type `cmd` and press **Enter** ‚Äî this will open Command Prompt directly in that folder.

4. **Run the program**
   Depending on your Python setup, one of these commands will start the program: \
    Option 1 (most common)
   ```bash
   main.py
   ```
   Option 2:
    ```bash
   python main.py
    ```
   Option 3:
    ```bash
   py main.py
    ```
5. **(First run only)**  
   - When you start the program for the first time, it automatically checks for required Python packages (like `keyboard`).
   - If something is missing, it installs it automatically.
   - Once the setup is complete, the program re-runs automatically and begins listening for key input.

6. **Done!**  
   The helper is now active and ready to use together with your configured OBS Studio hotkeys.  
   You‚Äôll see a message similar to:
    ```
   Helper running. Press ctrl+esc or ctrl+c in this window to stop.
   Listening for:
   g: NoLookie Map

   ```

## üíª Usage

1. **Keep the console window open**  
   The script must stay running while you stream.  
   You can minimize the console window, but do not close it ‚Äî if the program isn‚Äôt running, your OBS hotkeys won‚Äôt respond.

2. **About the F13‚ÄìF24 keys**
   - Most keyboards physically stop at **F12**, but Windows internally supports keys **F13** through **F24**.
   - These keys are ‚Äúvirtual‚Äù ‚Äî you can‚Äôt press them yourself, but this program can send them.
   - OBS can detect these virtual keys as hotkeys, which makes them perfect for automating map hiding and other actions.
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important:** The helper must be **running** while you configure OBS hotkeys.  
     If it isn‚Äôt running, OBS will not detect the virtual keys.

3. **Configure OBS hotkeys**
   - Open **OBS Studio ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Hotkeys**.  
   - Make sure the helper program is already running in the background.
   - When OBS asks you to set a hotkey:
     - To set **F13** (the ‚Äúshow‚Äù action): **hold your in-game key** (for example `G`).
     - To set **F14** (the ‚Äúhide‚Äù action): **release that same key**.
   - The helper will send the correct virtual keys to OBS while you press and release your chosen key.  
     OBS will then register them as `F13` and `F14`.

4. **Default behavior**
   - When you press your configured key (for example `G`), the script sends the assigned **‚Äúshow‚Äù** key (e.g. `F13`) to OBS.  
   - When you release the key, it sends the **‚Äúhide‚Äù** key (e.g. `F14`).
   - This allows OBS to toggle overlays, maps, or other sources automatically.

5. **Customize key mappings**
   - Open `config/variables.py` in a text editor.  
   - Modify or add entries in the `KEYS` list:
     ```python
     KEYS = [
         {
             "name": "NoLookie Map Cover",
             "input": "g",
             "show": "f13",
             "hide": "f14",
             "delay": 0
         }
     ]
     ```
   - Save the file and restart the program to apply your changes.

6. **Stop the helper**
   - Click the console window to make sure it‚Äôs focused.  
   - Press **Ctrl + Esc** or **Ctrl + C** to safely stop the program.

The tool will now handle your key presses automatically while you stream, ensuring your viewers can‚Äôt see sensitive in-game map information.

## üß© Troubleshooting

Having issues getting **obskeyhold.py** to work correctly?  
Here are some common problems and their solutions:

### üîπ OBS doesn‚Äôt detect the key when assigning F13‚ÄìF24
- Make sure **obskeyhold.py is running** before you open the OBS **Hotkeys** settings.  
- While setting a hotkey in OBS:
  - **Hold your configured key** (for example `G`) to set **F13**.
  - **Release it** to set **F14**.
- If OBS still doesn‚Äôt detect the input, restart both **OBS Studio** and **obskeyhold.py**, then try again.

### üîπ Nothing happens when pressing the key in-game
- Check that the console window says something like:
    ```
    Listening for:
    g: NoLookie Map Cover
    ```
- If it doesn‚Äôt show your key name, verify that the `input` value in `config/variables.py` matches the key you‚Äôre pressing (for example `"g"`).  
- Make sure the console window remains **open** and that the program is still running.  
- If you modified the config file, **save it** and then **restart the program**.

### üîπ The program closes instantly
- This usually happens if **Python** isn‚Äôt installed or isn‚Äôt added to your system PATH.  
- Check by running python --version` or `py --version` in Command Prompt.  
- If it says the command isn‚Äôt recognized, [download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and check **‚ÄúAdd Python to PATH‚Äù** during installation.
- You can also start the script manually to see any error messages:
```bash
  python main.py
```

### üîπ OBS hotkeys trigger the wrong source
- Double-check your hotkey setup in **OBS ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Hotkeys**:  
  - Each **Show Source** action should match your configured `show` key (for example `F13`).  
  - Each **Hide Source** action should match your `hide` key (for example `F14`).
- Avoid assigning the same F-key pair (like F13/F14) to multiple sources unless that behavior is intentional.

### üîπ Still not working?
If you‚Äôve verified all steps above and the tool still doesn‚Äôt respond:
1. Close both **OBS Studio** and **obskeyhold.py**.  
2. Reopen **OBS** first.  
3. Then run **obskeyhold.py** again.  
4. Try pressing your configured key.

If the issue continues, re-download the latest version from the [Releases](https://github.com/rileydeman/obskeyhold.py/releases) page to ensure you‚Äôre running the newest build.
